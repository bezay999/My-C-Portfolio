## About Me
I am a motivated final-year Game Development student, eager to gain real-world experience in software development.  
This repository showcases my practice projects in C#, demonstrating my understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and the ability to create functional console applications.

## Projects

### 1. CaesarCipher
**Description:** A console application that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Loops, arrays, string manipulation.

### 2. Quiz
**Description:** A simple console-based quiz game that asks multiple-choice or true/false questions and calculates the user's score.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Arrays, loops, user input, conditional statements.

### 3. SpaceMission
**Description:** A console simulation of a space mission scenario with simple user interactions.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Classes, objects, methods, console input/output.

### 4. VehicleGenerator
**Description:** A console application that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism through vehicle classes. The program creates different types of vehicles — Sedan, Truck, and a base Vehicle — each with their own properties and behavior. It showcases license plate generation, wheel defaults, speed handling, and method overriding such as improved SpeedUp() logic in child classes.
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, class inheritance, constructors, method overriding, encapsulation, string interpolation.
