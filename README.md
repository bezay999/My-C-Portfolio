## About Me
I am a motivated final-year Game Development student, eager to gain real-world experience in software development.  
This repository showcases my practice projects in C#, demonstrating my understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and the ability to create functional console applications.

## Projects

### 1. CaesarCipher
**Description:** A console application that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Loops, arrays, string manipulation.

### 2. Quiz
**Description:** A simple console-based quiz game that asks multiple-choice or true/false questions and calculates the user's score.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Arrays, loops, user input, conditional statements.

### 3. SpaceMission
**Description:** A console simulation of a space mission scenario with simple user interactions.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Classes, objects, methods, console input/output.

### 4. VehicleGenerator
**Description:** A console application that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism through vehicle classes. The program creates different types of vehicles — Sedan, Truck, and a base Vehicle — each with their own properties and behavior. It showcases license plate generation, wheel defaults, speed handling, and method overriding such as improved SpeedUp() logic in child classes.
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, class inheritance, constructors, method overriding, encapsulation, string interpolation.

### 5. BiblioInheritance
**Description:** A console application that demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism through library resource classes. The program creates different types of resources — Book, Periodical, Video, and a base Resource — each with their own properties and behavior. It showcases method overriding with `GetInfo()` and `UpdateStatus()`, as well as the use of constructors and additional class-specific properties.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, class inheritance, constructors, method overriding, polymorphism, encapsulation, console input/output.

### 6. CorporatePolymorphism
**Description:** A console application that demonstrates polymorphism and downcasting in a corporate employee hierarchy. The program creates different types of employees — HR, Engineer, Intern, and Manager — all derived from the abstract `Employee` class. It showcases method overriding (`SubmitDailyReport()` and `Work()`), the use of the `as` operator for downcasting, type checking with `is`, and array iteration through polymorphic objects.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, abstraction, polymorphism, method overriding, downcasting, type checking, virtual and abstract methods, arrays, console input/output.

### 7. DatingProfile
**Description:** A console application that simulates creating and viewing user dating profiles. The program allows storing personal information such as name, age, location, pronouns, favorite activity, and hobbies. It demonstrates how to work with classes, objects, properties, methods, and arrays, including updating object properties via methods and iterating over arrays.
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, class constructors, methods, arrays, string manipulation, console input/output.

### 8. EscapeRoomAdventure
**Description:** A console application that simulates elements of an escape room scenario with objects and systems. The program demonstrates **object references vs. value equality**, interface implementation, and polymorphism. It includes `FieldAgent` objects to show reference behavior, `File` objects to illustrate equality comparison, and `Server` objects implementing the `ISystems` interface to demonstrate polymorphic method calls.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, interfaces, polymorphism, object references vs. value types, equality comparison, arrays, console input/output.
